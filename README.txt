TODO:
Create the database
Create the sql to initialise the data base
determine what methods are necissary in the UI

come up with a sufficiently abstracted way of having methods perform different requests/updates
I.E., we don't want a bunch of methods each with a single associated command
Maybe a switch statement?, might be less confusing just to use lots of methods

Add methods in Database to perform the necessary updates and requests
create the UI
